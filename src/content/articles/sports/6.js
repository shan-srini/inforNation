        The winter olympic games are home to some of the most iconic events since the beginning of competitive sports. Every four years, the best athletes from across the globe come together to represent their nations in feats of strength, speed, endurance, and mind. And now, for the first time since 1445, the Olympic Committee has unanimously voted to include a new sport in this years games: fish juggling. A crowd favorite at the professional level, fish juggling is comprised of individual competitors ice fishing at the same time for as many fish as they feel necessary. Then, the competitors must juggle the live fish for a total of 1 minute without dropping. The competitors have 10 minutes to complete this feat, and it is up to their discretion where to allocate their time. At the end of the 10 minutes the competitor who juggled the most fish is victorious, and ties are broken by time to complete first, and number of fish caught next if necessary. I for one can not wait to see this sport go global, and I know we will all be watching together.
