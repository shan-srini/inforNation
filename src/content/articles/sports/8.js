      Famous philosophers and baseball enthusiasts Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were the first to pose the question, "Who's on first". While seemingly such a simple question, the answer is still up for debate. The typical response is simply, "yes" though this has sparked outrage and confusion amongst the baseball community. President Biden has recently deployed a task force to investigate this issue, though the public is uncertain that a commonality will be reached. While Abbott and Costello are no longer with us to guide this delicate situation, their famously televised debate will always be a subject for studying as this question is pondered. Their frustration and passion for this answer has only grown stronger with each generation as they can feel the answer coming soon. What's on second? I don't know, all I want to know is who's on first? Yes?
