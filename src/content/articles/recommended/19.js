        As any parent of a teenager can tell you, one of the scariest moments is
        when their beloved bundle of joy learns enough to navigate the web on
        their own. One day, your child might find themselves on a website
        dedicated to fanfiction. What do you do then? Have a serious talk with
        them, or pretend you didn't notice as they explore? Researchers from
        Golden Glizzy University think they might have come up with just the
        answer.

        The researchers from GGU, led by Dr. Andromeda Anastasia, have come to
        the conclusion that the best thing to do is to dredge up your own
        embarrassing fanfiction, and have a heart-to-heart with your child.
        Assure them that this is perfectly natural and nothing to be embarrassed
        about, but make sure they understand the need to tread carefully. Make
        sure they download an antivirus to ensure proper protection, and have
        them ask “would these characters really do this” before reading so that
        their beloved protagonists are not tainted by poorly-written stories.
        After this, assure them that you'll be available to talk to, and let
        them have their privacy.
