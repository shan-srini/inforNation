        In a perhaps misguided attempt to celebrate the new Sesame Street novel
        “Big Bird and You,” Swedish performance artists Kyle and Louise Krane
        uploaded a video of them performing a meta-interpretation of the novel's
        plot. Mr. Krane donned a Big Bird-like costume, and proceeded to read it
        to Mrs. Krane, who was locked in a cage. The demonstration lasted eight
        hours, letting the pair read through the book in whole. There is
        evidence of video-splicing during the video, indicating that the pair
        might have taken breaks so as to not be locked into the performance for
        the whole duration.

        The Kranes, upon questioning, had both much and nothing to say about
        their performance art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kyle: “Me in the costume and Lou in the cage is a meta-commentary on the
        intensity that Big Bird brings to the novel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Louise: “In a way, the reader is held captive by the novel, enraptured
        and forced to read and read until conclusion.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kyle: “We think it's a kind of meta-commentary on the way politics is
        all around us, never letting us be free from the weight of society.”
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find the Kranes' video on the internet, and “Big Bird and You”
        in bookstores everywhere.
