        The first day of the annual ventrilotarian meetup has gone off to a
        smashing success. To open up the ceremony, the president Sir Hans Vox
        recited “The New Colossus” from his left hand to much applause. Certain
        attendees clarified that Sir Vox was struggling for years to become
        ambidextrous in his ventriloquism. The art of motionlessly throwing your
        voice, making hand movements, and reciting stories and poems is quite
        the respected art indeed. On the second day, returnees will recite
        original poetry, followed by a catered dinner by Chipotle.

        “Give us your tired, your poor” indeed. We don't employ any
        ventrilotarians here at Renard News, but we have great respect for the
        skill that is involved, and look forward to the rest of the festival.
        Rumor has it that Willard Smith will be in attendance and do an
        impersonation of a Chris Rock set. Stay tuned for more breaking news on
        this much-beloved affair.
