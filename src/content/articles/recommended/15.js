        Disaster struck the National Winnie the Pooh Convention, leaving one
        dead and another injured. Somehow, a firearm was snuck into the
        convention and handed to a child. When the child's father noticed his
        son was holding a gun, his shock caused the child to accidentally
        discharge the weapon, going through his shoulder and into the chest of
        an Eeyore cosplayer. Both were rushed to the hospital where treatment
        was provided, but only the father survived his wounds.

        The police have looked at the firearm's serial number and determined it
        belonged to Maximillian Gunthry, who lives in the town over. Mr. Gunthry
        has been arrested, but claims to have an alibi for the time of the
        shooting and that his weapon had been stolen days prior. Whatever the
        truth of this is, the police will get to the bottom of this and we'll
        keep you updated.
