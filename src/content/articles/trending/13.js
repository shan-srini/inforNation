        Scientists have performed the unthinkable by successfully regrowing a
        man's face on his knee, allowing transplantation to where it ought to
        be. Dr. Kim Bull and her team have figured out how to regrow the various
        parts of a face, giving many who have suffered catastrophic wounds a
        second chance. The first lucky patient in question, Richard Kingler,
        lost much of his face in a tragic Slip-n-Slide accident 40 years ago,
        and was selected as a subject for this pioneering operation in medicine.

        Despite the foreseen 34% chance of success, Dr. Bull is pleased to
        announce that the tissue-generation and subsequent transplantation went
        off without a hitch. Mr. Kingler is currently in recuperation and
        relearning how to talk, and cannot wait to go home to his wife. After
        performing more instances of this surgery, Dr. Bull and her team intend
        to start research into regrowing whole limbs.
