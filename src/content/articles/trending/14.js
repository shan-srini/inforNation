        In a recent study by Gravy-Stock Simulations Incorporated, it was
        discovered that having employees work outside increases productivity by
        43%. When questioned, representatives of GraSS Inc. provided details
        about how they set up a temporary office in “a random field somewhere,”
        where they paid employees twice the salary to relocate and work in a
        different environment. If this discovery holds true, it will
        revolutionize business as we know it, and maybe the ecosystem as well.

        If a sudden shift from gray offices to green meadows were to overtake
        the corporate scene, the towering skyscrapers of today would diminish
        incredibly, with the conservation and floral maintenance industries
        receiving incredible amounts of capital in order to prepare these new
        “eco-offices.” The ecological benefit of more green spaces should be
        obvious, meaning cleaner air for all as the grass eats the carbon
        dioxide. No longer will traffic smog up our cities, for greener pastures
        await us all.
